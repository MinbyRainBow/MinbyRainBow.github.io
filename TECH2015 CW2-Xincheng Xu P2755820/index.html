			'Wild animals are an important part of the ecosystem on which humans depend. The protection, development, and rational use of wild animal resources are of great significance to maintaining ecological balance, improving the natural environment, and promoting sustainable and stable social and economic development. The behavior of eating precious and endangered wild animals in society is not only a bad social habit, but also one of the reasons why illegal hunting and killing of rare and endangered wild animals has been repeatedly prohibited. "No profit leads to no extinction.',
			'Animals are an important renewable resource on the planet. Since the beginning of human beings, the utilization of animal resources has always been one of the important factors for human survival. However, with the growth of population and the development of science, human beings dependence on animal resources has increased. Due to the deterioration of the environment and the shrinking space for animals to live, the contradiction between supply and demand has become increasingly prominent.',
			'With the development of human society, the dependence of modern human beings on wild animals has decreased. However, the demand for wild animals as medicinal materials, food, decorations, hunting souvenirs, handicrafts, fur and feather products, pets, etc. is increasing. Over exploitation of wild animal resources due to trade is one of the reasons why wild animal species are endangered. Commercial exploitation of wildlife resources. Commercial exploitation refers to the large-scale exploitation of wildlife resources for the purpose of commercial profit, and its driving force is for trade, because wildlife trade is profitable.',
			'1.1 Insufficient understanding of the importance of protecting wild animals. Wild animals are closely related to human survival. To protect wild animals is to protect the ecological environment on which human beings live, and to protect human beings themselves. At present, the most prominent problem in the management of wild animals is the lack of sufficient awareness of the importance of protecting wild animals. People have not raised the level of protecting wild animals to the level of protecting humans, and the phenomenon of destroying wild animals and their habitats occurs from time to time.。',
			'1.2 The legal system of wildlife protection is not perfect. The legislative purpose of the Wildlife Protection Law is mainly to protect rare and endangered wild animals. There are no clear regulations on non-key wild animals, and there is a lack of specific methods, standards, and technical regulations for wildlife protection. And other relevant supporting regulations, it is difficult to operate in actual work, and it can no longer meet the needs of wildlife protection.',
			'1.3 The wild animal protection and management system is not sound enough. At present, the municipal forestry department is responsible for the management and protection of all forestry resources and wetlands, including the protection and management of terrestrial wild animals. The number of personnel engaged in wildlife protection is relatively small and lacks a certain degree of professionalism: the township people governments have not set up professional posts and personnel dedicated to the protection and management of terrestrial wildlife, and there are problems such as an imperfect management system and a weak management team.',
			'2.1 The countermeasure for wildlife protection and management is to increase the ecological environment protection of wildlife habitats. For wildlife sanctuaries, the basic principles of priority protection and sustainable development must be adopted. In the wild animal sanctuary, it is necessary to achieve all-round protection, mainly to prevent the theft of wild animals, prevent the threat of fire, prevent damage to the ecological environment of the sanctuary, and prevent the killing of wild animals. It is forbidden to put wild animals and their products protected by laws and regulations into the market, to prohibit any organization or individual from buying, selling and smuggling wild animals and their products in any form, to prohibit other irrelevant creatures in wild animal protection areas, and to prohibit development in nature reserves without permission. other production activities.',
			'2.2 Speed up the legislative process and fill in the protection gap. The higher authorities should continue to strengthen the top-level design, speed up the revision of the Wildlife Protection Law, and expand the scope of wildlife protection. At the same time, in response to problems such as unclear law enforcement margins in the existing wildlife protection and management, relevant supporting laws and regulations should be introduced to improve the legal system, promote law-based supervision and law-based administration, and enable wildlife resources to be fully and effectively protected.',
			'2.3 Carry out joint prevention and control, and strengthen the management team. Set up a special wildlife management organization, introduce and train professional management talents, and strengthen the construction of protection management teams; further clarify the responsibilities of various departments for wildlife protection and supervision, and optimize the specifics of wildlife protection and illegal punishment Division of responsibilities; ensure the effective cooperation of relevant departments such as market supervision, agriculture, forestry, and public security, carry out joint special operations in a timely manner, and work together with multiple departments to jointly protect the wildlife resources in the city.',
			'2.4 Innovate mechanisms and increase investment in protection.Party committees and governments at all levels must attach great importance to wildlife protection, and guarantee a certain amount of capital investment every year, which is dedicated to the construction of wildlife protection infrastructure, publicity and education, monitoring and rescue, and case investigation. At the same time, it is possible to innovate mechanisms, actively mobilize social forces to participate in wildlife protection by absorbing social funds, and provide support for the healthy development of wildlife protection.For a strong backing.'
